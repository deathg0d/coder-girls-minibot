This git repo is part of the [Coder Girls Initiative 2018](https://naya.com.np/collection/c1519918123293bqm48?sortby=latest) organized by Naya in Kathmandu, Nepal.

In this project we use one sender micro:bit that sends gesture information over to another receiver micro:bit through radio. The receiver micro:bit then uses the gesture info to control dc motors and thus moving the minibot.

List of items required:
* 2 x Micro:bits - 1 receiver and 1 sender
* 1 x Microbit Edge Connector
* 1 x L298N Motor Driver
* Female/Female Jumper Wires
* 6 x AA Batteries (or 8 if you need more speed)
* 1 battery holder accomodating 2 AA batteries
* 1 battery holder accomodating 4 (or 6) AA batteries
* 2 x caster wheels
* 2 x Motor and wheel set
* Double Sided Tape
* 1 x Box
* 4 x M3x25mm screws
* Screw Driver

Wire connections for the Minibot (Between receiver Micro:bit and motor driver):
