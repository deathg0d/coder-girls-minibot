This git repo is part of the [Coder Girls Initiative 2018](https://naya.com.np/collection/c1519918123293bqm48?sortby=latest) organized by Naya in Kathmandu, Nepal.

In this project we use one sender micro:bit that sends gesture information over to another receiver micro:bit through radio. The receiver micro:bit then uses the gesture info to control dc motors and thus moving the minibot.
